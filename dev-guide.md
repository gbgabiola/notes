## Guide To Becoming A Self-Taught Software Developer

### 1. Figure Out Your End Goal

- Work for a big company, startup, freelance?
- Web development (frontend/backend), gaming, data science, mobile apps?
- What are you naturally good at?
- Check pay scales, job security, etc for different types of dev jobs

### 2. Choose A Programming Language

- Figure out which language you should learn for what you want to do
  - **Python**: Data Science, Machine Learning, AI
  - **Swift**, **Java**: Mobile Development
  - **C++**: Game Development
  - **JavaScript**, **PHP**, **Ruby**, **Python**, etc: Web Development
- Fundamentals first! (Save framework, etc for later)
- Chose a text editor / IDE and get comfortable with it
- You can always switch or learn another language

### 3. Find Resources & Build A Curriculum

- **Books**: Great for learning language fundamentals
- **Documentation**: Best used for reference
- **Resource Websites**: W3Schools, MDN Web Docs
- **Video Courses**: Youtube, Udemy, Pluralsight, Lynda, Coursera, etc
- **Online Bootcamps**: FreeCodeCamp, Codeacademy, Treehouse
- **Challenge Websites**: Codewars, HackerRank

### 4. Find A Community

- Having people to talk to and learn from is very benifitial
- Find a mentor if possible
- Join an online community
- Go to meetups

### 5. Create Your Own Projects

- Following along with courses is only half the battle
- This is where most get stuck and many quit
- Your projects do NOT have to be from scratch
- Add new features, use the docs as a supplement to figure new stuff out
- Look at other people's code that is similar to what you want to achieve
- Eventually you won't need to use other projects as a starting point

### 6. Create Your Portfolio

- Create an attractive but simple portfolio
- Showcase a live version (if possible) and your source code
- Self taught developers NEED a great portfolio with work examples

### 7. Contribute to Open Source

- Gives you experience with real-life projects
- Collaborate with other developers
- Something for your resume
- Learn how to use Github


### 8. Create an Online Presence

- Also extremely importnt for self-taught devs with no degree
- Have an up to date LinkedIn and professional Twitter
- Upload all of your work to Github and keep it well documented
- Write articles, tutorials, videos, etc
- The more your are visible on the web, the better

### 9. Prepare & Apply to Jobs

- All other boxes should be checked
- Prepare for interviews, practice algorithms, create a resume, cover letter, etc
- Search for jobs in your area that are looking for things you know
- Apply even if it says a degree required
- Remember...it is your <u>first</u> job, not your last

### Full Stack Developer

On the front-end, the full stack web developer uses a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build everything a user sees and interacts with on a website. On the back-end they develop the application, server, and database that make up the foundational structure of a website. Their skills are often centered around solution stacks like LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) or MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, Node.js) which contain all the technologies required to set up a complete website.

#### Sample Summary of Web App Developer / Software Engineer

Senior Software Engineer (Java and Web Dev)

A senior developer with 5+ years in the field of Front-end and Java. I can work on both front-end and back-end part of a project, which also includes but not limited to: designing, data structure, development, optimization, testing, and deployment.

I'm flexible with changes needed to meet-up the requirements. I'm confident in my skills and I'm very open to new technologies and knowledge that I might acquire.

My previous projects include mostly e-Commerce websites, banking web application, and social media. Also, I mostly work on several APIs that serve both Mobile and Web apps.
