## Taking Notes

1. Why take notes?
   - Output just as important as input
   - To transfer information from short-term to long-term memory, it has to be reviewed
2. Using the right tools
   - Computer vs. paper
     - Research on effectiveness of each
       1. Princeton study results
       2. Syntax vs. Meaning
     - How to use a computer without the downsides
       1. Acknowledging working memory constraints
       2. Using apps to block distractions
3. What to focus on when taking notes
   - Gauge each class early on
     - look at the syllabus
     - pay attention to any study guides or review materials
     - make mental notes about different types if questions on tests
   - Things to focus on
     - "This is important" - verbal cues from the lecturer
     - Big ideas - summaries, overviews, or conclusion
     - Bullet lists
     - Highlighted items
     - Headings
     - Terms and definitions
     - Examples
       1. Very important especialy when applying concepts and formulas to problems, E.g. Math, Physics, Programming
4. Note-Taking systems
   - Cornell Note-Taking System
     - Created by Walter Pauk at Cornell University and detailed in _How to Study in College_
     - Three sections
       1. Cue column
          - Write down questions that weren't answered or prompts for later review based on your notes
       2. Notes column
          - Take notes here normally during lecture using any other method (outline method is most likely)
       3. Summary column
          - Use this area to briefly summarize the lecture content right after class
     - Purpose of Cornell Notes: Cut down on your study time later on though creating cues and forcing you to recall big ideas early through summarization
   - Outline Method
     - Nested bullet list
     - Benefits
       1. Makes it easy to create a chronological record of the lecture
       2. Higher-level ideas are visually separated from small details through nesting
     - Drawbacks
       1. Not very flexible
       2. Hard to make really important things stand out
       3. Hard to connect concepts together
   - Mind Mapping Methods
     - Creates a very visual, branching map of all the details in a concept
     - Benefits
       1. Flexible, easy to draw pictures, diagrams, etc
       2. Create for brainstorming
     - Drawbacks
       1. Messy method that fills paper and makes it hard to record things in great details
       2. Not as easy to search on later


## Reading Assignments

1. How do you know what reading actually do?
   - Assigned Readings
     - Main Textbooks
     - Supplemental Readings
       1. Arguments
       2. Description
       3. Context
2. Boost reading speed
   - Eye
     - Periphery
     - Parafovea
     - fovea
       1. Saccade
       2. Fixation
       3. Regression
   - Working Memory
     - 4 chucks
       1. Pause frequently when reading
   - Speed Reading Techniques (They said its ineffective)
     - increase amount of text to process during each fixation
     - eliminate subvocalization (reads aloud in your head when you read silently)
   - Practice
   - Pseudo-skimming technique
     - keeping an eye with main ideas
     - vocabulary terms
     - first and last sentence of each paragraph
     - boldings, italics or other formattings
3. How to Remember More
   - Highlighting
     - **Remember**: it's easy to mistake recognition with true recall
   - Two Ways to remember
     - Recall it
     - Recognize it
   - Morse code method
     - using standardized sequences of short and long marks or pulses
     - "dots" and "dashes"
   - Active Reading
     - SQ3R - Survey, Question, Read, Recite, and Review
       1. Survey
          - Pre-reading
          - skim the whole thing quickly
          - overview
          - headings
          - review questions
       2. Question
          - write questions that comes to mind before reading
          - to prime your brain to pick the most important bits
       3. Read
          - catch all word from taking notes or
          - summarizing what you read
       4. Recite
       5. Review
     - SCAR - Stop Complaining And Read


## Memory

1. Sensory Memory
   - Processes pretty much everything your senses detect or experience in the real world
   - Has the attention span of a five-year-old at the DMV; most of what it takes in is lost almost immediately
   - What does stick moves into short-term or working memory
     - working memory can only handle 4-7 bits of items of information at a time
2. Why we forget things
