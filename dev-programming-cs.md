## [What are the growth stages of a programmer?](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-growth-stages-of-a-programmer/answer/Frank-Taylor-5)

### White Belt
You don't know what you don't know.

- You know some syntax, a few keywords.
- You can come up with a dozen variations on Hello World.
- You don't even know how to Google your questions; it's very hard for you to even figure out how to even ask how to do the thing you want to do.
- You don't yet know the difference between good code and bad code. Which means your code is bad.

### Yellow Belt
You know what you don't know, but you don't know very much

- Syntax has improved, and you know more keywords.
- You've successfully made a thing run, without debugging.
- You can't write a full program from start to finish, but you can get pretty far.
- You can kind of figure out how to Google your questions.
- You have a rough idea what bad code looks like.

### Orange Belt
YOU KNOW CODE-FU! You've pretty much learned everything at this point.

- You've learned basically all of the keywords, and you totally get the syntax.
- Your stuff runs successfully, and you can make the program do the thing you want to.
- You can Google any question you have.
- You can successfully identify bad code. And it's everywhere.
- People are idiots and terrible coders.

### Purple Belt
You're practically a master; getting to master is all about learning those nunchaku. I mean, there's a few things here or there you don't know about, but you're leveling up all the time.

- There's a few "neat tricks" in the language. Ternary operators are spiffy, Regexes are handy. There's a bunch of stuff you can do on arrays
- Your stuff runs successfully, and if you have time, you try to optimize it.
- Abstraction is starting to click; it's important to be DRY and separate concerns
- [framework] is pretty cool, you should totally check it out
- Some of those guys in Google search results are idiots. You have to be careful where you get your information.
- You know that you've written some bad code
- You're writing some good code because other people tell you so
- You wonder why people don't optimize their code more often

### Brown Belt
Dude, it's not just about nunchucks. That why you learned the Sai, and the Bo, and the eskrima. You're all four ninja turtles wrapped up into one post-adolescent mutant ninja coder. You can convert red bull and pizza into über optimized 1s and 0s.

- You can use every neat trick in your language. Every variable is a ternary operator of some sort. Bitwise FTW. Why use a find and replace method when you can just do it in one long regex?
- Your stuff runs; but if you've got time you do some unit testing.
- You abstract everything everywhere all the time. Separation of concerns, man!
- [framework] is the best and anyone who says otherwise is wrong. That's why you write plugins for it!
- You've written a few blog posts, or answered a few questions on Stack Overflow.
- You consistently write good code; people can count on you for writing good stuff
- Other people compliment you on your creativity in using obscure features of your language
- You wonder why everyone doesn't optimize their code more; don't they care about optimization?

## Black Belt
You know that scene from Indiana Jones and the the Raiders of the Lost Ark, where this one bad guy is awesome with a sword, and Indy just shoots him? You're Indy; you don't care about the flashy tricks any more, it's just about doing what makes sense. You know what you don't know, but you know you don't know very much.

- Neat Tricks are exactly that: neat tricks. You use "hacks" sparingly, because, just like Harrison Ford, you've gotten sick and you don't have time for a long, convoluted solution.
- framework] has some flaws. that's why you've got [framework] or [framework].
- You know what? None of those frameworks do the thing you need; that's why you've been working on this new framework.
- Your code is documented, and readable.
- Your code passes unit tests, and that's more important than, "it runs."
- You abstract when necessary; you have crap to do.
- You've answered a lot of Stack Overflow questions because you've found out there's lots of ways to do the same thing.
- There's no such thing as good code. All code could be better.
- You wonder why you don't code as well as everyone else.

I'm not entirely sure where I rank, but I am absolutely certain that I was an Orange belt for much longer than I thought. I think it's very easy to reach Orange Belt status and think that you know how to program.

While a Brown belt knows most of the features of a language, the Black belt finally knows when to use them.


## What skills do self-taught programmers commonly lack? What should a self-taught programmer study to get up to speed with his/her formally-educated peers?

### Humility
Someone quite interestingly commented on "humility" as a thing that self-taught programmers lack. I agree.

I've been plagued by Impostor Syndrome for a long time, and I think that's kept me humble and driven me to want to study and practice as much as possible, for fear of getting "found out".

There's no shame in being proud of the fact that you taught yourself, but you should be aware of the limitations of your teacher.

### Algorithms
This is classic computer science right here. Programming without knowledge of algorithms is like carpentry with just one kind of saw: you can get the job done, but it's going to take a lot longer.

You can look at an algorithm as "discipline". When you learn to write them, what you're doing is solving a problem with discipline; using structure, patterns, and logical steps.

When you don't know how to discipline your mind, you don't know how to write algorithms.

Not only can you not write algorithms unless you've studied them, you don't know how many algorithms others have written, too.

I spent four days trying to figure out how to do a permutation. I was so proud of myself when I figured it out. Right up until I discovered that B.R. Heaps had figured it out in 1963.

### Design Patterns
This comes with Education and/or Experience. There's more than one way to structure your code, and there's a right time and a wrong time for each. You either need to make mistakes along the way and learn when to use each pattern, or learn from someone else who's already made the mistake (a teacher).

### Programming Paradigms
Object-Oriented Programming is not The Way. Neither is Functional Programming. Nor Reactive Programming. It is A Way.

There are different ways to program, and they each have a purpose. Not only that, some languages are naturally better-suited for one paradigm or another.

If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.

Take that into self-taught programming and you'll find yourself hammering in nails, screws, staples, and thumb tacks.

I remember a self-taught .NET programmer actually telling me once, "well, it's not programming unless it's object-oriented. And that's why I don't consider JavaScript a programming language." That's a very, very flawed train of thought.

### Data Structures
Granted, your language can give you a basic idea of what the different data structures are. But again, that's a basic idea.

Self Taught programmers can have a tendency to only stick to data structures that work within their favorite language. Just because it's not a primitive, or even a common structure in your language, that doesn't mean it can't exist. Of course, that also means that maybe it shouldn't exist, either.

The world is very small if it all can fit inside of an array.

### Testing
Maybe it's just me, but there's a lot of ways to test your code before pushing it to an environment. Learn how to do unit testing.

More importantly, learn test-driven development.

There's a difference between testing your code, and writing testable code.

For me, The Pragmatic Programmer was a big help.
