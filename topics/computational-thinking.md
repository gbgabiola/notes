# Computational Thinking

**Computational Thinking** is the term used to describe what it means to think like a computer. It's all about using the specific and unique capabilities of computers - including their strengths and weaknesses - to solve problems.

In computer programming, the word _problem_ just means a challenge or issue that isn't solved yet.


## Four Fundamental Principles of Computational Thinking

1. **Decomposition** is the process of breaking a BIG problem or challenge down into smaller and smaller ones, until all the problems are small enough to easily solve.
2. **Abstraction** goal is to omit specific details and to focus on the general pattern
3. **Pattern Recognition** is looking at all the smaller problems and see if they have any commonalities or if you can use similar methods to solve them
4. **Algorithm Writing** is writing a series of instructions that explain how to solve a problem


## 5 Stages of Communicating with Computers

1. At stage 1 we have you, the human being, thinking big, complex thoughts;
2. At stage 2, we have you, the human, learning how to think like a computer; This is called computational thinking!
3. At stage 3, we have you, the human, learning to translate that thinking into a computer programming language like JavaScript;
4. At stage 4, we have a computer program that translates JavaScript into 0's and 1's;
5. And finally, at stage 5, we have the computer receiving the message as 0's and 1's.
