## [5 Non-Technical Skills That Will Make You A Successful Programmer](https://medium.com/@kerisavoca/5-non-technical-skills-that-will-make-you-a-successful-programmer-34d9d5a3ddfa)

### 1. Logical Thinking and Reasoning

For every problem, there are many potential solutions. For every brick wall, there are many potential workarounds. If you are able to think logically and reason with yourself, you’ll find a way to accomplish anything you need to do.

### 2. Giving and Receiving Feedback

Other people will be looking at your code, and chances are that they will tell you what they think. You’ll get positive feedback and you’ll get some criticism, but all feedback is valuable. Giving and receiving feedback will help you become a better programmer, especially when you’re stuck.

### 3. Patience

You will spend a lot of time looking at code that doesn’t work, or code that doesn’t look great, or code that isn’t efficient. Now is not the time to throw in the towel. Your patience will go a long way in helping you consider the many potential solutions to a challenge.

### 4. Attention to Detail

Programming can feel very solitary, but many times, you are programming something that other people are also working on. Your attention to detail is important; any changes you make could affect your collaborators, and sloppy code is more than just a minor inconvenience.

### 5. Public Speaking

You don’t necessarily have to give speeches in front of large crowds, but you will reap numerous benefits if you are comfortable presenting your work (and your works in progress) to others.
