## A letter to myself as a fresh software engineer

Dear Myself,

You just graduated and you are ready to start your career in the IT field. I cannot spoiler anything, but I assure you it will be an interesting ride. I'm writing you this letter because I want to give you some advice that will help you be a better professional. Nothing you won't learn by yourself in the next few years, but it is something that I wish someone had told me when I started my career. They are not ordered by any means and are **all equally important**.

- Run a marathon, not a sprint
- Be humble, not stupid
- Compare with yourself, not others
- Respect people, not titles
- Choose the challenge, not comfort
- Jump on the whiteboard, not on the keyboard
- Deliver value, not code
- Choose life, not work
