## Web Design Cheatsheet

The **Designer** creates the look and feel. The **Developer** builds it.

**User Interface** is the presentation of a product, designing how it looks and feels. **User Experience** is the overall experience the user has with a product.


### Beautiful Typography

Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language readable and beautiful.

1. Use a font size between 15 and 25 pixels for body text
2. Use big font sizes for Headlines (60px or 90px with less font weight and 32px for Subheadlines)
3. Use line spacing between 120 and 150% of the font size.
4. 45 to 90 characters per line
5. Use Good Fonts (sans-serif and serif)
  - Sans-serif (more neural, clean, simple, modern websites)
    - Open Sans, Lato, Raleway, Monsterrat, PT Sans
  - serif (traditional purposes, story telling, long reading)
    - Cardo, Merriweather, PT Serif
6. Chose a font which reflects the look and feel you want for your website
7. Use only one font if possible


### Using Colors Like A Pro

1. Use only one base color
2. Use a tool if you want to use more colors
3. Use color to draw attention
4. Never use black in your design
5. Choose colors wisely

#### The Meaning Of Colors In Web Design

Picking a color for a website means more then picking your favorite color and turning it into a design. It means picking the right color in order to get the desired response from your audience. Color really makes a difference. This happens because there are psychological effects behind each color.

- **Red** is a great color to use when power, passion, strength and excitement want to be transmitted. Brighter tones are more energetic and darker shades are more powerful and elegant.
- **Orange** draws attention without being as overpowering as red. It means cheerfulness and creativity. Orange can be associated with friendliness, confidence, and courage.
- **Yellow** is energetic and gives the feeling of happiness and liveliness. Also, it associates with curiosity, intelligence, brightness, etc.
- **Green** is the color of harmony, nature, life and health. Also, it is often associated with money. In design, green can have a balancing and harmonizing effect.
- **Blue** means patience, peace, trustworthiness, and stability. It is one of the most beloved colors, especially by men. It is associated with professionalism, trust and honor. That's actually why the biggest social networks use blue.
- **Purple** is traditionally associated with power, nobility and wealth. In your design, purple can give a sense of wisdom, royalty, nobility, luxury, and mystery.
- **Pink** expresses romance, passivity, care, peace, affection, etc.
- **Brown** is the color of relaxation and confidence. Brown means earthiness, nature, durability, comfort, and reliability.
