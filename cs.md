# Computer Science Concepts


- [Programming](#programming)
- [Writing Code](#writing-code)


## Programming

- Dictory definition: the process of preparing an instructional program for a device
- Layman's Terms: attempting to get a computer to complete a _specific task_ without making mistakes
- Not-Intelligent (Computers)
  - Can only work based on _our commands_
  - FAR from competent, so we must give them _EXACT_ instructions on how to do their task (Dumb)
  - Computer's are only only _smart_ because we program them to be
- Language of Code
  - Computers only understand **machine code**
    - A series of 0's and 1's which interpreted by the computer
    - We need to _convert_ our instructions from English to Binary in order for the computer to understand them
  - One Problem
    - It would be entirely unpractical to convert every programming instruction into binary by hand
- Programming Languages
  - Translate our instructions into **machine code**
  - Very useful for programmers
  - Serves as _interpreters_ for converting languages into other languages
    - Faster than converting by hand
- High vs Low Level
  - Each language has an attribute known as **power** or **level**
    - Basically how similar it is to machine code
  - **Low-level** programming languages: Assembly or C
  - **High-level** programming languages: Java or Python
  - Lower the level -> More similar to machine code


## Writing Code

- IDE's (**Integrate Development Environments**)
  - A place to write, run, debug code and converts it to machine code
  - IDE's are like any other program on our computer except used for the facilitation of code, e.g., (NetBeans, IntelliJ, Visual Studios)
  - Looks: Usually has central area for writing code, console, project hierarchy, preview screens, etc.
- IDE Functionality
  - Built-in _Error-checking_
  - Auto-fill for frequently used words
  - Project Hierarchy
- Learning Languages
  - Learning a computer language can be very similar to learning a real language
  - All programming languages have a **set of rules** to follow when writing code in that language, just like in real languages
    - In computer science it is called _syntax_
  - Similar to grammar in real life languages
- **Syntax**
  - Rules we must follow if we want our program to run correctly
    - How we type out certain functions
    - What to put at the end of each line of code
    - How to set up certain functions
  - Syntax for each programming languages are _unique_
  - Breaking programming rules will result in an _error_
