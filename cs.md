## Programming

- Dictory definition: the process of preparing an instructional program for a device
- Layman's Terms: attempting to get a computer to complete a _specific task_ without making mistakes
- Not-Intelligent (Computers)
  - Can only work based on _our commands_
  - FAR from competent, so we must give them _EXACT_ instructions on how to do their task (Dumb)
  - Computer's are only only _smart_ because we program them to be
- Language of Code
  - Computers only understand **machine code**
    - A series of 0's and 1's which interpreted by the computer
    - We need to _convert_ our instructions from English to Binary in order for the computer to understand them
  - One Problem
    - It would be entirely unpractical to convert every programming instruction into binary by hand
- Programming Languages
  - Translate our instructions into **machine code**
  - Very useful for programmers
  - Serves as _interpreters_ for converting languages into other languages
    - Faster than converting by hand
- High vs Low Level
  - Each language has an attribute known as **power** or **level**
    - Basically how similar it is to machine code
  - **Low-level** programming languages: Assembly or C
  - **High-level** programming languages: Java or Python
  - Lower the level -> More similar to machine code


## Writing Code

- IDE's (**Integrate Development Environments**)
  - A place to write, run, debug code and converts it to machine code
  - IDE's are like any other program on our computer except used for the facilitation of code, e.g., (NetBeans, IntelliJ, Visual Studios)
  - Looks: Usually has central area for writing code, console, project hierarchy, preview screens, etc.
- IDE Functionality
  - Built-in _Error-checking_
  - Auto-fill for frequently used words
  - Project Hierarchy
- Learning Languages
  - Learning a computer language can be very similar to learning a real language
  - All programming languages have a **set of rules** to follow when writing code in that language, just like in real languages
    - In computer science it is called _syntax_
  - Similar to grammar in real life languages
- **Syntax**
  - Rules we must follow if we want our program to run correctly
    - How we type out certain functions
    - What to put at the end of each line of code
    - How to set up certain functions
  - Syntax for each programming languages are _unique_
  - Breaking programming rules will result in an _error_


## Get Information from Computers

- The Console
  - Programmers keep track of their progress by looking at **the console**
    - A _text interface_ within the computer that programmers can use for a variety of purpose
- How to Use the Console
  - Main use of the _console_ is to output text from the program using **code**
    - **Print statement** _prints_ text to the _console_ for the programmers viewing pleasure
- Using the print Statement
  - Simply instruct the console to print, and include it _inside the parenthesis_
    - Using _python_, e.g., `print ("Hello Word")
  - Print statement is also usef for viewing and interpreting the computer's output from a program
- A Background Tool
  - The console is mainly a _Developer Tool_
    - Not usually meant to be used and interacted with by the end user except in very **abstract cases**
      - Text-based games/simple programs
  - Tends to be hidden away behind the scenes
  - Don't try and implement the console in the final product
