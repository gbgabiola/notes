## Programming

- Dictory definition: the process of preparing an instructional program for a device
- Layman's Terms: attempting to get a computer to complete a _specific task_ without making mistakes
- Not-Intelligent (Computers)
  - Can only work based on _our commands_
  - FAR from competent, so we must give them _EXACT_ instructions on how to do their task (Dumb)
  - Computer's are only only _smart_ because we program them to be
- Language of Code
  - Computers only understand **machine code**
    - A series of 0's and 1's which interpreted by the computer
    - We need to _convert_ our instructions from English to Binary in order for the computer to understand them
  - One Problem
    - It would be entirely unpractical to convert every programming instruction into binary by hand
- Programming Languages
  - Translate our instructions into **machine code**
  - Very useful for programmers
  - Serves as _interpreters_ for converting languages into other languages
    - Faster than converting by hand
- High vs Low Level
  - Each language has an attribute known as **power** or **level**
    - Basically how similar it is to machine code
  - **Low-level** programming languages: Assembly or C
  - **High-level** programming languages: Java or Python
  - Lower the level -> More similar to machine code
