## Learning

- **focused versus diffuse thinking**
  - **focused mode** has tight spacing for the rubber bumpers which seems to, in some sense, help keep your thoughts concentrated.
  - **diffuse mode** has more widely spaced bumpers that allow for more broad ranging ways of thinking
- **way to tackle procrastination**
  - Pomodoro Technique: 25 minute stretch of focused concentration, followed by a bit of mental relaxation
- **practice and repetition**
  - helps enhance and strengthen the neural structures we're building as we're learning something new
  - particularly important for more abstract topics
- **memory**
  - **working memory:**
    - there are four slots in our working memory
    - things can fall out of those slots unless we keep repeating them to hold them in mind
    - not very good blackboard
  - **long term memory:**
    - like a storage warehouse
    - practiced and repeated something well enough to get it into long term memory
    - can usually call it up later if you need it, although you may need an occasional bit of repetition to freshen the memory up
    - never cram your learning by repeating things many times all in one day
      - that's like trying to build muscle by lifting weights all in one day
      - no time for solid structures to grow
- **sleep**
  - sleep can wash away the toxins that develop during our day's activities
  - you want to avoid taking tests or doing anything difficult with little sleep the night before
    - that's like trying to think with poison on the brain
- **exercise**
  - valuable in helping improve both our memory and our ability to learn.

## Chunking

- **chunks**
  - pieces of information, neuroscientifically speaking, that are bound together through use and often through meaning
  - think of a chunk as a scintillating network of neurons that compactly synthesizes key ideas or actions
  - can get bigger and more complex
  - single easy to access item that you can fit like a ribbon into the slot on your working memory
- **build chunks:**
  - with **focused**
  - **undivided attention**
  - **understanding of the basic idea**
  - and **practice**
- **recall**
  - trying to remember the key points without looking at the page, is one of the best ways to help the chunking process along
  - helps build neural hooks
  - helps you better understand the material
  - try recalling material in places that are different from where you originally learned the material
    - becomes more deeply ingrained and accessible, regardless of what room you're in
    - very helpful for tests
- **transfer**
  - idea that a chunk you've mastered in one area can often help you much more easily learn chunks of information in different areas that can share surprising commonalities
- **interleaving**
  - your learning by practicing your choice of different concepts, approach, and techniques all in one session
- **illusions of competence**
  - learn to recognize when you're fooling yourself about whether you're actually learning the material
  - test yourself frequently
  - using little mini-tests to see whether you're actually learning the material, or whether you've been fooling yourself, thinking you're learning when you're actually not
  - recall is a form of mini-testing
- **avoid depending too much on highlighting**  
  - try to avoid depending too much on highlighting, which can fool you into thinking that the material is going into
your brain when it actually isn't
- **mistakes are a good thing** to make when you're learning
  - allows you to catch illusions of competence
- **deliberately practice** what you find more difficult to gain full mastery of the material
  - avoid practicing only the easy stuff, which can bring the illusion that you've mastered the material
- **einstellung**
  - initial thought, an idea you've already had in mind, or a neural pattern you've already developed well and strengthened
  - prevents a better idea or solution from being found
  - or keeps you from being flexible enough to accept new, better, or more appropriate solutions
- **The Law of Serendipity**
  - lady Luck favors the one who tries
  - just pick one tiny thing out to learn, then another
  - just keep trying and you'll be pleasantly surprised at the results


## Procrastination and Memory  

### Procrastination

- learning well often involves bit by bit, day by day building of solid neural scaffolds
  - rather like a weight lifter builds muscle with day to day exercise
  - this is why tackling procrastination is so incredibly important
  - you want to keep up with your learning and avoid last minute cramming
- **focus on process not product**
  - process means, the flow of time and the habits and actions associated with that flow of time
  - avoid concentrating on product to prevent procrastination
  - processes relate to simple habits, habits that coincidentally allow you to do the unpleasant tasks that need to be done

**Key aspects of tackling procrastination:**

1. **Keep a planner journal**
   - to easily track when you reach your goals and observe what does and doesn't work
2. **Commit yourself to certain routines and tasks each day**
   - write your planned tasks out the night before so your brain has time to dwell on your goals and help ensure success
   - arrange your work into a series of small challenges
3. **Delay rewards until you've finished a task**
   - always make sure you, and your zombies, get lots of rewards
   - take a few minutes to savor the feelings of happiness and triumph, which also gives your brain a chance to temporarily change modes
   - deliberately delay rewards until you've finished a task
4. **Watch for procrastination cues**
   - try putting yourself in new surroundings with few procrastination cues, such as the quiet section of a library
5. **Gain trust in your new system**
   - you want to work hard during times of focused concentration
   - trust your system enough so that when it comes time to relax, you actually relax without feelings of guilt or worry
6. **Have back up plans for when you still procrastinate**
7. **Eat your frogs first every day**
   - do your most unpleasant task first

### Memory

- **long term memory**
  - like a storage warehouse
  - practice and repeat in order to help store items in long term memory so you can retrieve them more easily
  - practicing and repeating, all in one day, is a bad idea
  - extend your practice to several days
  - this is why tackling procrastination is important
  - helps you build better memories, because you start earlier
- **working memory**
  - like a poor blackboard that quickly fades
  - can only hold about four items in your working memory
  - when you master a technique or concept, it compacts the ideas to occupy less space in your working memory when you do bring them to mind
    - this frees your mental thinking space so that it can easily grapple with other ideas
- **visual and spatial memory systems**
  - tapping into those systems, will help improve your memory
  - try making a very memorable visual image representing one key item you want to remember
  - beyond merely seeing, try to feel, hear and even smell something you're trying to remember
  - the funnier and more evocative the image is, the better
  - repetition over several days is really helpful
- **create meaningful groups**
  - to simplify the material is another key to memorization
  - try associating numbers with years or with systems you're familiar with like running times
  - many disciplines use memorable sentences
- **memory palace technique**
  - placing memorable images in a scene that's familiar to you
  - allows you to dip into the strength of your visual memory system
  - provides a particularly powerful way of grouping things you want to remember
- **conclusion**:
  - by making meaningful groups and abbreviations, you can simplify and chunk what you're trying to learn so you can more easily store it in memory
  - by memorizing material you understand, you can internalize the material in a profound way
  - you're reinforcing the mental library you need to become a genuine master of the material


## Renaissance Learning and Unlocking Your Potential

- **metaphors and analogies** aren't just for art and literature
  - not only remember, but more easily understand concepts in many different fields
  - the more visual, the better
- **change your thoughts, change your life**
  - people can enhance the development of their neuronal circuits by practicing thoughts that use those neurons
  - like Santiago Ramon y Cajal, you can take pride in aiming for success because of the very things that make other people say you can't do it 
- **testing tips**
  - going through your own test preparation checklist can vastly improve your chances of success
- **hard start then jump to easy technique**
  - counterintuitive strategies such as the hard start jump to easy technique, can give your brain a chance to reflect on harder challenges even as you're focusing on other more straightforward problems
- **tackle nervousness**
  - body puts out chemicals when it's under stress
  - how you interpret your body's reaction to those chemicals makes all the difference
  - shifting your thinking from, this test has made me afraid, to this test has got me excited to do my best, helps improve your performance
  - if you're panicked on a test, momentarily turn your attention to your breathing
    - relax your stomach, place your hand on it, and slowly draw a deep breath
    - your hand should move outward and your whole chest should expand like a barrel
