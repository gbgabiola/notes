## Install WSL

- type `Windows features` in windows
- ‘Turn Windows features on or off’
- put a check next to ‘Windows Subsystem for Linux
- then restart
- Windows store, search for ‘Linux’, and go ahead and install Ubuntu.
- Install Linux

- [How do I use Bash on Ubuntu on Windows (WSL) for my VS Code terminal?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44450218/how-do-i-use-bash-on-ubuntu-on-windows-wsl-for-my-vs-code-terminal)

- in bash `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh | bash`
- (instructions I'm getting from here) https://github.com/creationix/nvm/blob/master/README.md#installation
- After that, close, then reopen your terminal, and run `command -v nvm`
- `nvm install 10.1`
- `nvm use 10.1`
- `nvm alias default 10.1`
- `npm install -g npm@latest`
- `mkdir projectName`
- to check where you are `echo ~`
- `mkdir -p ~/proj/folderName && cd ~/project/projectName`
- `git init`
- `npm init -y`
- Open the terminal in VSC `Ctrl + ` `
- Go into `package.json`
- Under name add `"private": true,`
- Give it a name, description if you want, then git commit and we'll get a basic web page going before we add tooling
- to display `ls /mnt/c/users/<name>/projectName`?
- moving files `mv ~/projectName /mnt/c-or-d/projectName`
- install and configure `eslint` and `.editorConfig` will help with the formatting and style of your code.
- create a file .editorConfig

editorConfig

```
root = true
[*]
charset = utf-8
end_of_line = lf
trim_trailing_whitespace = true
insert_final_newline = true
indent_style = space
indent_size = 2
[*.md]
indent_size = 4
```

```sh
npm install --save-dev eslint-config-airbnb-base`
```

That's for when you're doing React

```sh
(
  export PKG=eslint-config-airbnb-base;
  npm info "$PKG@latest" peerDependencies --json | command sed 's/[\{\},]//g ; s/: /@/g' | xargs npm install --save-dev "$PKG@latest"
)
```

- I just copy pasted that from here just so you know how I came up with that :stuck_out_tongue: https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb-base#eslint-config-airbnb-base-1
- create a file `.eslintrc.js`

```js
'use strict';

module.exports = {
  root: true,
  extends: 'airbnb',
  parser: 'babel-eslint',
  parserOptions: {
    sourceType: 'script',
  },
  env: {
    es6: true,
  },
  rules: {
    'no-console': ['warn', {
      allow: ['error', 'warn'],
    }],
    'prefer-destructuring': 0,
  },
  overrides: [
    {
      files: [
        'src/**/*.js',
      ],
      parserOptions: {
        sourceType: 'module',
      },
      env: {
        browser: true,
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

- `git add -A .`
- `git commit -m "initial commit"`
- create a file `.gitignore`

```sh
###################
*.com
*.class
*.dll
*.exe
*.o
*.so
# Packages #
############
*.7z
*.dmg
*.gz
*.iso

```

- create a file `.nvmrc`

```sh
9.11.1
```

- `ls -A`
- Don't use beatify anymore. `eslint` and `.editorConfig` are MUCH better for that
- One thing is node_modules was accidently added to git, `.gitnore` fixes that though
`git rm -rf node_modules && npm install`

- `npm i -D http-server`
We're intalling an npm package called "http-server"
https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server

- Just above `"test"`
`"start": "http-server docroot",` in `package.json` file
Then try running `npm start`

- Ok soo make a new git commit
`git add -A .`
`git commit -m "set up basic dev environment"`

- Make a folder `docroot`
- And in there `index.html`

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <title>Test</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    
  </body>
</html>
```

- `npm i -D webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server`
- Make `src/index.js`
```console.log('ey');```
- Replace `"start": "webpack-dev-server",`
- `npm rm -D http-server`
- `npm i -D babel-eslint`

- add a script `"build": "webpack",` in package.json
- then run `npm run build`, it will add a `dist` folder with `main.js`
- configure webpack

## Install MongoDB in WSL

### Install MongoDB Community Edition

You can follow the installation documentation from the [mongodb official website](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/) and select the distro of your choice.

1. Copy and paste this into your terminal `wget -qO - https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-4.2.asc | sudo apt-key add -` and operation should respond with an OK. This will import the public key used by the package management system
2. Next, copy and paste this `echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu bionic/mongodb-org/4.2 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-4.2.list` to create a list file for MongoDB.
3. Reload local package database by typing `sudo apt-get update`.
4. Finally, type `sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org` to install the latest stable version of the MongoDB packages.

### Add the data directory to store databases

1. Make sure you are on the root of the WSL, type `pwd` it should output `/home/<user>/`. If not, type `cd ~`. 
2. Create a `data`, by typing `mkdir data`.
3. Type `echo "mongod --dbpath=data --nojournal" > mongod` to store the command to mongod.
4. Lastly, type `chmod a+x mongod` to change the permission

### Run mongod server and mongo shell

1. Type `./mongod` to start mongod server.
2. You can now open a new terminal and type `mongo` to launch mongo shell.
3. Go the [Getting Stated Manual of MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/getting-started) to try various examples for querying in the MongoDB shell.
4. To exit the shell, press `ctrl + c`. You should get a neat message, then you'll be returned to your command line!

## [How to Install Python 3.6.1 in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS](http://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2017/07/install-python-3-6-1-in-ubuntu-16-04-lts/)

This quick tutorial is going to show you how to install the latest Python 3.6.1 in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS via PPA.

Ubuntu 16.04 comes with both Python 2.7 and Python 3.5 by default. You can install Python 3.6 along with them via a [third-party PPA](https://launchpad.net/~jonathonf/+archive/ubuntu/python-3.6) by doing following steps:

1. Open terminal via Ctrl+Alt+T or searching for "Terminal" from app launcher. When it opens, run command to add the PPA:

```sh
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jonathonf/python-3.6
```

Type in your password (no visual feedback due to security reason) when it asks and hit Enter.

2. Then check updates and install Python 3.6 via commands:

```sh
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install python3.6
```

Now you have three Python versions, use `python` command for version 2.7, `python3` for version 3.5, and/or `python3.6` for version 3.6.1.


3. To make `python3` use the new installed python 3.6 instead of the default 3.5 release, run following 2 commands:

```sh
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python3 python3 /usr/bin/python3.5 1

sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python3 python3 /usr/bin/python3.6 2
```

Finally switch between the two python versions for `python3` via command:

```sh
sudo update-alternatives --config python3
```

After selecting version 3.6:

```sh
python3 -V // or python3 --version
```

**UPDATE**: due to this [bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python3.6/+bug/1631367), gnome-terminal won’t launch after step 3, a workaround is running following commands to recreate the symlink:

```sh
sudo rm /usr/bin/python3

sudo ln -s python3.5 /usr/bin/python3
```


## Get your terminal
- Download Hyper.js [here](https://hyper.is/)

## Automatically open the terminal in Bash
- Open up Hyper and type `Ctrl` + `,`
- Scroll down to shell and change it to `shell: 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\bash.exe' then `shellArgs: ['--login']` or `shell: 'wsl.exe'` then `shellArgs: []`

## Install Zsh
- Run `sudo apt-get install zsh`
- Open bash profile `nano ~/.bashrc`
- Set ZSH as default:

```sh
# Launch zsh
if [ -t 1 ]; then
exec zsh
fi
```

or `bash -c zsh`

## Install a framework for ZSH
- Install Oh My Zsh with `sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"`
   - Read docs [here](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) on how to add more plugins and change themes (I went with their out of the box 'robbyrussell').

## Add plugins in zsh
- open .zshrc file `nano ~/.zshrc`
- It will look like this `plugins=(git colored-man-pages zsh-syntax-highlighting zsh-autosuggestions)`

## Fix the ls and cd colours
Out of the box when you `ls` or `cd` + `Tab` you get a ugly background colours on the directories. To fix this, open ~/.zshrc file and add this to the end:

```sh
#Change ls colours
LS_COLORS="ow=01;36;40" && export LS_COLORS

#make cd use the ls colours
zstyle ':completion:*' list-colors "${(@s.:.)LS_COLORS}"
autoload -Uz compinit
compinit
```

## Install Git
- Run this `sudo apt update`
- Then run `sudo apt install git`

## Install Node Version Manager

It is a little slow but is a known issue. To make the startup time a little faster:

```sh
# Defer initialization of nvm until nvm, node or a node-dependent command is
# run. Ensure this block is only run once if .bashrc gets sourced multiple times
# by checking whether __init_nvm is a function.
if [ -s "$HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh" ] && [ ! "$(whence -w __init_nvm)" = function ]; then
  export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
  [ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && . "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"
  declare -a __node_commands=('nvm' 'node' 'npm' 'yarn' 'gulp' 'grunt' 'webpack')
  function __init_nvm() {
    for i in "${__node_commands[@]}"; do unalias $i; done
    . "$NVM_DIR"/nvm.sh
    unset __node_commands
    unset -f __init_nvm
  }
  for i in "${__node_commands[@]}"; do alias $i='__init_nvm && '$i; done
fi
```

## Install Ruby on Rails with rbenv

### Step 1: Install rbenv and Dependencies

```sh
$ sudo apt update

# install the dependencies required for ruby
$ sudo apt install autoconf bison build-essential libssl-dev libyaml-dev libreadline6-dev zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libffi-dev libgdbm5 libgdbm-dev

# Clone the rbenv repo into the directory ~/.rbenv
$ git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv

# Add ~/.rbenv/bin to $PATH to use the rbenv command line utility
$ echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc # or ~/.zshrc

# Add this script so that rbenv loads automatically
$ echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc # or ~/.zshrc

# Next, apply the changes you made by:
$ source ~/.bashrc # or ~/.zshrc

# Verify if set up is succesful by using type command an rbenv:
$ type rbenv

# Install ruby-build plugin to simplify the installation process for new versions of ruby

$ git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
```

### Step 2: Installing Ruby with ruby-build

```sh
# List all the available versions of Ruby:
$ rbenv install -l

# Install Ruby 2.5.1 (specific version):
$ rbenv install 2.5.1

Set it as default version of Ruby
$ rbenv global 2.5.1

# Verify that Ruby was properly installed
$ ruby -v
```

### Step 3: Working with Gems

Gems are the way Ruby libraries are distributed. You use the `gem` command to manage these gems. We’ll use this command to install Rails.

When you install a gem, the installation process generates local documentation. This can add a significant amount of time to each gem’s installation process, so turn off local documentation generation by creating a file called `~/.gemrc` which contains a configuration setting to turn off this feature:

```sh
$ echo "gem: --no-document" > ~/.gemrc

# Install bundler to manage gem dependencies for projects
$ gem install bundler
```


You can use the `gem env` command (the subcommand `env` is short for `environment`) to learn more about the environment and configuration of gems. You can see where gems are being installed by using the `home` argument, like this:

```sh
$ gem env home

# Output:
/home/sammy/.rbenv/versions/2.5.1/lib/ruby/gems/2.5.0
```

### Step 4: Installing Rails

To install Rails, use the `gem install` command along with the `-v` flag to specify the version. For this tutorial, we will use version `5.2.0`:

```sh
$ gem install rails -v 5.2.0
```

The `gem` command installs the gem you specify, as well as every dependency. Rails is a complex web development framework and has many dependencies, so the process will take some time to complete. Eventually you’ll see a message stating that Rails is installed, along with its dependencies:

```sh
Output
...
Successfully installed rails-5.2.0
38 gems installed
```

**Note**:

If you would like to install a different version of Rails, you can list the valid versions of Rails by doing a search, which will output a long list of possible versions. We can then install a specific version, such as `4.2.7`:

```sh
$ gem search '^rails$' --all
$ gem install rails -v 4.2.7
```

If you would like to install the latest version of Rails, run the command without a version specified:

```sh
$ gem install rails
```

rbenv works by creating a directory of **shims**, which point to the files used by the Ruby version that’s currently enabled. Through the `rehash` sub-command, rbenv maintains shims in that directory to match every Ruby command across every installed version of Ruby on your server. Whenever you install a new version of Ruby or a gem that provides commands, like Rails does, you should run:

```sh
$ rbenv rehash
```

Verify that Rails has been installed properly by printing its version, with this command:

```sh
$ rails -v
```

If it installed properly, you will see the version of Rails that was installed:

```sh
Output
Rails 5.2.0
```

At this point, you can begin testing your Ruby on Rails installation and start to develop web applications. Let’s look at keeping rbenv up to date.

### Step 5: Updating rbenv

Since you installed rbenv manually using Git, you can upgrade your installation to the most recent version at any time by using the `git pull` command in the `~/.rbenv` directory:

```sh
$ cd ~/.rbenv
$ git pull
```

### Step 6: Uninstalling Ruby versions

As you download additional versions of Ruby, you may accumulate more versions than you would like in your `~/.rbenv/versions` directory. Use the `ruby-build` plugin's `uninstall` subcommand to remove these previous versions.

```sh
rbenv uninstall 2.1.3
```

### Step 7: Uninstalling rbenv

Open your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file in your editor, then find and remove the following two lines from the file:

```sh
...
export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(rbenv init -)"

# Save the file and exit the editor
# Remove rbenv and all installed Ruby versions
rm -rf `rbenv root`

# Log out and back in to apply the changes to your shell
```

## Install PostgreSQL

```sh
$ sudo apt-get update

# Install PostgreSQL and its development libraries
$ sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib libpq-dev

# Check version
psql --version
```

### Create Database User

Create a PostgreSQL superuser user, change the `pguser`

```sh
$ sudo -u postgres createuser -s pguser
```

If you want to set a password for the database user, enter the PostgreSQL console with this command:

```sh
$ sudo -u postgres psql
```

The PostgreSQL console is indicated by the postgres=# prompt. At the PostgreSQL prompt, enter this command to set the password for the database user that you created:

```sh
postgres=# \password pguser
```

Enter your desired password at the prompt, and confirm it.

Now you may exit the PostgreSQL console by entering this command:

```sh
postgres=# \q
```

## Install MySQL

```sh
$ sudo apt-get update

# Install MySQL and its development libraries
$ sudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client libmysqlclient-dev
```

When the installation is complete, we need to run some additional commands to get our MySQL environment set up securely. First, we need to tell MySQL to create its database directory structure where it will store its information. You can do this by typing:

```sh
$ sudo mysql_install_db

# Run a security script to remove some dangerous defaults and lock down access to our database system
$ sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

You will be asked to enter the password you set for the MySQL root account. Next, it will ask you if you want to change that password. If you are happy with your current password, type `n` at the prompt.

For the rest of the questions, you should simply hit the "ENTER" key through each prompt to accept the default values. This will remove some sample users and databases, disable remote root logins, and load these new rules so that MySQL immediately respects the changes we have made.

MySQL is now installed, but we still need to install the MySQL gem.

### Install MySQL Gem

`mysql2` gem provides provides a functionality to connect your Rails application to a MySQL server.

```sh
$ gem install mysql2
```

## How to Uninstall (or Reinstall) Windows 10’s Ubuntu Bash Shell
### How to Uninstall the Ubuntu Environment and Keep Your Home Folder

To remove the downloaded Bash environment, open a Command Prompt window and run the following command. This will uninstall and delete the Ubuntu user environment from your system, including any Linux applications you downloaded and installed with apt-get or by compiling them from source.

`lxrun /uninstall`

![uninstall](https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ximg_5775b6e48c76c.png.pagespeed.gp+jp+jw+pj+ws+js+rj+rp+rw+ri+cp+md.ic.8WCVcHMC-F.png)

This command won’t delete your home folder and the files in it. If you’d like to completely wipe the Linux system, see the next section.

### How to Uninstall the Ubuntu Environment and Delete Your Home Folder
The above command won’t delete your Ubuntu user account’s home folder. The home folder contains user preferences and files. If you install a new Ubuntu user space image, the files in your home folder will be preserved and carried over.

If you want to prevent this from happening, you’ll need to remove the downloaded Bash environment and completely wipe your home folder. To do so, run the following command:

`lxrun /uninstall /full`

You’ll be asked to confirm your choice. To automatically accept the confirmation, run the `lxrun /uninstall /y /full` command instead.

![uninstall full](https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ximg_5775d5727fb2a.png.pagespeed.gp+jp+jw+pj+ws+js+rj+rp+rw+ri+cp+md.ic.JTG6PTaTpY.png)

### How to Reinstall the Ubuntu Environment
To reinstall the Bash environment, you can just run the bash command again, as you did when installing Bash the first time. If a Ubuntu user space image isn’t installed, it will automatically download and install it.

You can also run the following command yourself. This is the same command that bash.exe automatically runs if you launch it without a Ubuntu user space image installed.

`lxrun /install`

Whether you run `bash` or `lxrun /install`, the command will ask you to confirm your choice and enter a username and password for the user account in the Bash environment.

To skip this process, you can run the following command instead. This command will automatically agree to the prompts, setting the "root" account as the default user account without a password. This is helpful if you want to automate the process of installing Bash in a script.

`lxrun /install /y`

![install](https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ximg_5775b6a54bc16.png.pagespeed.gp+jp+jw+pj+ws+js+rj+rp+rw+ri+cp+md.ic.O7ApTrPisX.png)

### How to Remove Windows 10’s Bash Tools Completely
If you’d like to remove the bash.exe tool and the Windows Subsystem for Linux from your computer completely, you’ll need to revisit the "Turn Windows Features On or Off" dialog in the Control Panel.

To find it, open the Control Panel and head to Programs > Turn Windows Features On or Off.

Uncheck the "Windows Subsystem for Linux" option here and click OK. Windows will uninstall the Windows Subsystem for Linux, bash.exe, and lxrun.exe commands. You can always revisit the Windows Features dialog to reinstall them in the future.

![remove completely](https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ximg_5775d5a6d9307.png.pagespeed.gp+jp+jw+pj+ws+js+rj+rp+rw+ri+cp+md.ic._PkHXdKHls.png)

## Rails Setup:

```sh
#### If you want to use SQLite (not recommended)
rails new myapp

#### If you want to use MySQL
rails new myapp -d mysql

#### If you want to use Postgres
# Note that this will expect a postgres user with the same username
# as your app, you may need to edit config/database.yml to match the
# user you created earlier
rails new myapp -d postgresql

# Move into the application directory
cd myapp

# If you setup MySQL or Postgres with a username/password, modify the
# config/database.yml file to contain the username/password that you specified



# Create the database
rake db:create

rails server
```

Troubleshooting:

- [rvm installation not working](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9336596/rvm-installation-not-working-rvm-is-not-a-function)

```sh
# You need to run the following
$ source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm

# then run this
$ type rvm | head -n 1

# and if you get

rvm is a function

# to see dependency requirements for your operating system
$ user$ rvm requirements

# put this code into you ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc file and you will not need to write this code again.
```

To permanently resolve this:

```sh
[[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && source "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm"

# From: ~/.bash_profile file
# To: ~/.bashrc file

# Reason this works is that .bashrc is executed each time you enter terminal, and .bash_profile each time you login. That is why solution /bin/bash --login works, but you have to do that each time you enter terminal. This way you are set until your next format, and you will forget all this by then :)
