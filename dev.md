## Web Development Basics

- What is web development
  - How websites work
    - **website** is simply a collection of web pages of codes, codes that describes that layout, format, and content on a page
    - **web server** is a internet-connected computer that receives the request for a web page sent by your browser
    - **domain name** is the address that you type into your web browser address bar to get a website
      - example of a domain name is https://google.com
    - **browser** connects your computer to the server
  - Front-end and Back-end
    - **Front-end** is that part of the website that you see and interact with directly in your browser
      - also known as the client-side
    - **Back-end** is part that everything that happens behind the scene
      - it is also about how website works
      - it's also known as server-side
  - Code editor
    - **code edit** is one of the most essential tool that you will use to build a website
    - this provides the means for a programmer to create and modify (edit) programming language source code
    - some of the most popular free code editors
      - VS Code
      - Sublime Text
      - Ato
  - Basic Front-end
    - What is HTML
      - HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
      - HTML stands for **Hyper Text Markup Language**
      - HTML describes the structure of a Web page
      - HTML consists of a series of elements
      - HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
      - HTML elements are represented by tags

      - CSS rule set consists of a selector and a declaration block, e.g., `h1 { color: blue; }`
    - What is JavaScript
      - JavaScript is a programming language that was designed to run in the browser
        - you can make your website dynamic, meaning it will respond to different inputs from the user, or other sources
      - one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:
        1. **HTML** to define the **content** of web pages
        2. **CSS** specify the **layout** of web pages
        3. **JavaScript** to program the **behavior** of web pages
  - Tools
    - package managers
    - build tools
    - version control
  - Additional Front-end
    - SAAS
    - responsive design
    - JavaScript frameworks
  - Basic Back-end
